# Algerian_Forest_Fires Dataset Project EDA Project

* I used a dataset on Algerian Forest Fires from UCI. The dataset contains a culmination of forest fire observations and data in two regions of Algeria: the Bejaia region and the Sidi Bel-Abbes region.
* The timeline of this dataset is from June 2012 to September 2012. In this project, we focused on whether certain weather features could predict forest fires in these regions using few Classification algorithms.
* As per the Task given i choose regression problem to predict fire weather index



# UNDERSTANDING THE GIVEN TASK

* Import the dataset. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Algerian+Forest+Fires+Dataset++#
* Do proper EDA(analysis) of your dataset and create a report, then perform necessary preprocessing steps

# DATA EXPLORATION

In this step, we will apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract insights from the data set to know which features have contributed more in predicting Forest fire by performing Data Analysis using Pandas and Data visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn. It is always a good practice to understand the data first and try to gather as many insights from it.

Below are tasks to be performed in EDA:

1. Importing Libraries

2. Data Cleaning for EDA Report

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on all Features
